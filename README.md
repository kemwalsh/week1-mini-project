## Description:

- As a client, I want to view a single webpage that collects a visitor's contact information.

- As a client, I want the landing page to have a header and footer.

- As a client, I want the landing page to have an image with a caption.

- As a client, I want the landing page to have a contact form.

- As a client, I want the landing page to have a polished and accessible UI.

## User Story

- It's done when the page uses semantic HTML elements.

- It's done when the page uses universal, element, and class selectors in CSS.

- It's done when the page features at least three colors in the design.

- It's done when the page uses a single font and font family for all text.

- It's done when the page uses at least two heading elements (`<h1>` through `<h6>`).

- It's done when the header is fixed to the top of the page on scroll.

- It's done when the header contains a navigation bar with three links that display inline, including a contact link.

- It's done when, if the contact link is clicked, the page jumps directly to the contact form.

- It's done when the contact form includes `input` elements for name and email.

- It's done when the contact form includes a Send button.

- It's done when the image includes a descriptive `alt` attribute.

- It's done when the page is deployed to GitHub Pages.
